## Pictures for creating a Camera Matrix

**Camera model: Nikon D300S 24mm f4**

To create your own camera matrix, take at least 10 pictures with the same camera of the reference object from different angles, then run the _Create Camera Matrix_ function in the program

_Note: a perfect camera matrix is difficult to acquire, you may want to try a few times with different sets of pictures and validate the outcome by doing some measurement tests_
